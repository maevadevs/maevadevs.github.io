Hi! I am Maeva!

I have enjoyed taking courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and reading books and blogs to increase my understanding of Web and Mobile software development. I then started to get more involved in the JS community since 2014. I enjoy working with JavaScript, Python, and recently, I have been delving into C#.

Meet me also on [Stackoverflow](https://stackexchange.com/users/9569098/maevadevs), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~maevadevs) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maevaralafi?lang=en)!

Happy coding!
