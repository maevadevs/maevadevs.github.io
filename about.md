Hi! I am Maeva!

I like to learn and read about technology, specifically about the Cloud, Web, and Mobile development. I have been involved with the JavaScript community since 2014, and I have been exploring Azure Cloud since 2018 though I also have experience with Google Cloud and Heroku. I enjoy working with JavaScript, Python, C#. On the side, I am a musician who plays piano and guitar. In short, I am a computer geek who also loves arts and the outdoor.

Meet me also on [Stackoverflow](https://stackexchange.com/users/9569098/maevadevs), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~maevadevs) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maevaralafi)!

Happy coding!
