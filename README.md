Hi! I am Maeva!

I have enjoyed taking courses on Udemy and reading books and blogs to increase my understanding of Web and Mobile software development. I then started to get more involved in the JS community since 2014. I enjoy working with JavaScript, Python, and recently, I have been delving into C#.

This repo contains the source code of my Jekyll blog.
