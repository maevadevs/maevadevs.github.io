Hi! I am Maeva!

I like to learn and read about technology, specifically about the Cloud, Web, and Mobile development. I have been involved with the JavaScript community since 2014, and I have been exploring Azure Cloud since 2018 though I also have experience with Google Cloud and Heroku. I enjoy working with JavaScript, Python, C#. On the side, I am a musician who plays piano and guitar. In short, I am a computer geek who also loves arts and the outdoor.

This repo contains the source code of my [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) blog. I am using [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for fast build process.
